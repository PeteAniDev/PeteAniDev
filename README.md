## About Me

Hi, I'm Pete Karesisto, an indie game developer who's also working as an indie animator at the same time. I've dedicated my days, nights, and weekends to work on my projects and make devlogs about them. I have a unstoppable desire for freedom and I'll always work forward for it.

I mostly use Java to develop my games, and these are the programs and libraries I use:

- Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
- Lightweight Java Game Library 3
- Adobe Animate
- Aseprite
- Steam API
- Java OpenGL Math Library
- Clip Studio Paint
- OBS Studio
- Adobe Premier
- Audacity
